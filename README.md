# visual-network
A visual network mapping using vis.js to map out a network

## What this is being used for

Just to map out my own home network. It's probably been done once over by a lot of others, but this is a hobby project to learn a bit more on web development using express


## How to run it

use 

```bash
node server.js
```

to launch the app. Then head over to your localhost port 8080
